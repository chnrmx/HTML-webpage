        <h3>Here are some simple steps you can start doing to have a fulfilling, Joyful, and succesfull life.</h2>
 <ol>
     <li><strong>Be with others who make you smile.</strong>
     Studies show that we are happiest when we are around those who are also happy.
     Stick with those who are joyful and let rub off on you.</li><br>

     <li><strong>Accept the good.</strong>
      Look at your life and take stock of what’s working, and don’t push away something just
     because it isn’t perfect. When good things happen, even the very little ones, let them in.</li><br>

     <li><strong>Do things you love</strong>
      Maybe you can’t skydive every day or take vacations every season, but as long as you get
     to do the things you love every once in a while, you will find greater happiness.</li><br>

     <li><strong>Listen to you heart</strong>
      Maybe you can’t skydive every day or take vacations every season, but as long as
     you get to do the things you love every once in a while, you will find greater happiness.</li><br>

     <li><strong>Be open to change</strong>
     Even if it doesn’t feel good, change is the one thing you can count on. Change will happen,
     so make contingency plans and emotionally shore yourself up for the experience.</li><br>
